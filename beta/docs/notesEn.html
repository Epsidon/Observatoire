<b>Mother Tongue</b>
<br>
	<p>
	Mother tongue refers to the first language learned at home in childhood and still understood by the person at the time the data was collected. If the person no longer understands the first language learned, the mother tongue is the second language learned. For a person who learned two languages at the same time in early childhood, the mother tongue is the language this person spoke most often at home before starting school. The person has two mother tongues only if the two languages were used equally often and are still understood by the person. For a child who has not yet learned to speak, the mother tongue is the language spoken most often to this child at home. The child has two mother tongues only if both languages are spoken equally often so that the child learns both languages at the same time.

	</p>
</br>

<b>Knowledge of official languages</b>
<br>
	<p>
	Knowledge of official languages refers to whether the person can conduct a conversation in English, French, in both or in neither language. For a child who has not yet learned to speak, this includes languages that the child is learning to speak at home.

	<b>Language spoken most often at home </b>
		<br>
			<p>
			Language spoken most often at home refers to the language the person speaks most often at home at the time of data collection. A person can report more than one language as "spoken most often at home" if the languages are spoken equally often.
		</br>
		<p>
			For a person who lives alone, the language spoken most often at home is the language in which he or she feels most comfortable. For a child who has not yet learned to speak, this is the language spoken most often to the child at home. Where two languages are spoken to the child, the language spoken most often at home is the language spoken most often. If both languages are used equally often, then both languages are included here.

	<b>Local Health Integration Network (LHIN)</b>
	
	<p>
	In 2006, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care divided the province into 14 regions or Local Health Integration Networks (more succinctly known as LHINs) because, it was thought, people living locally were better able to plan, fund and integrate health services in their own communities. By April 1, 2007, LHINs took on full responsibility for health services in their communities.

	<H4>Dissemination Areas</H4>
	A dissemination area (DA) is a small, relatively stable geographic unit composed of one or more adjacent dissemination blocks. It is the smallest standard geographic area for which all census data are disseminated. DAs cover all the territory of Canada.

	To ensure confidentiality, the values, including totals, are randomly rounded either up or down to a multiple of '5' or '10.' To understand these data, you must be aware that each individual value is rounded. As a result, when these data are summed or grouped, the total value may not match the individual values since totals and sub-totals are independently rounded. Similarly, percentages, which are calculated on rounded data, may not necessarily add up to 100%.

	<p>Data Source:	Health Professions Database, 2011 Submission</p>
	
	<b>Notes:</b>
	<p>1. The Health Professions Database (HPDB) collects up to 5 'Languages of Care", which is defined as 'Languages in which the member can provide professional services". </p>
	<p>2. The HPDB captures the number of ‘active’ health professionals who are registered by their respective regulatory College to practice in their profession in full or any one capacity (clinical, research, teaching health promotion, etc.). Members may or may not be working in the profession. This data does not include members who hold educational registrations.</p>
	<p>3. Practice site by LHIN information refers to the first practice site listed in the HPDB. The HPDB collects employment data for up to three different practice sites and the first site listed is not necessarily the 'primary' practice location. Not all RHPs who hold an active registration listed a valid practice site in Ontario, or were working in their profession. As such numbers quoted may not sum to 2011 totals.</p>

	<b>Health Profiles</b>
	<p>Data Source: Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), 2001 to 2012</p>
	<p>Notes:</p>
	<p>Results come from eight cycles of the CCHS performed by Statistics Canada in 2001 (cycle 1.1), 2002 (cycle 1.2), 2003 (cycle 2.1), 2004 (cycle 2.2), 2005 (cycle 3.1), 2007 (cycle 4.1), 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.</p>

	<P>The target population of the CCHS is composed of Canadians aged 12 and older, living in private households in the 10 provinces and 3 territories.Excluded are residents of Indian reserves and crown lands, people living in institutions, full-time members of the Armed Forces, and residents of certain remote regions.
	</P>

	<b>Study Population </b>
	<br>Francophones (n = 5,827) and anglophones (n = 259,861) residing in the 14 LHINs in Ontario. </br>

	<p>
	The proportions shown are based on the calculation of frequency distributions, weighted to represent the entire target population. Certain categories of responses were aggregated to obtain the number of observations required for the release of results according to the standards of Statistics Canada. When the numbers are too small even after aggregation, the data cannot be made public.
	</p>

	<p>
	An algorithm was created based on language variables present in the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS): conversational language, mother tongue, the language of the interview and in the preferred language of contact during the survey. This algorithm identifies French speakers, anglophones and allophones.
