If the person no longer understands the first language learned, the mother tongue is the second language learned. For a person who learned two languages at the same time in early childhood, the mother tongue is the language this person spoke most often at home before starting school. The person has two mother tongues only if the two languages were used equally often and are still understood by the person. For a child who has not yet learned to speak, the mother tongue is the language spoken most often to this child at home. The child has two mother tongues only if both languages are spoken equally often so that the child learns both languages at the same time.<br />

          </p>
         <p>
		 A designation under the The French Language Services Act (FLSA) is recognition that an agency has met the government’s designation criteria in providing French language services to its French-speaking clients and has demonstrated its ability to continue to do so. Before the government will designate an organization, the organization must:
		 </p>
		 <ol>
			<ul>
				•	offer quality services in French on a permanent basis;</ul>
				•	guarantee access to its services in French;</ul>
				•	have French-speaking members on its board of directors and in its executive;</ul>
				•	develop a written policy for services in French that is adopted by the board of directors and that sets out the agency's responsibilities with respect to services in French.
			</ul>
		 </ol>
		 
		 <p>
			Complete designation: If an organization is designated as a public service agency under the FLSA, the organization is subject to the FLSA in all respects.
		 </p>
		 
		 <p>
			Partial designation: However, a regulation designating a public service agency may limit the designation to apply only to specific services provided by the agency, or may specify services that are excluded from the designation.
