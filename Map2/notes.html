<p>Notes:</p>

<ol>
<li>The Health Professions Database (HPDB) collects up to 5 'Languages of Care", which is defined as 'Languages in which the member can provide professional services". </li>				
<li>The HPDB captures the number of ‘active’ health professionals who are registered by their respective regulatory College to practice in their profession in full or any one capacity (clinical, research, teaching health promotion, etc.). Members may or may not be working in the profession.  This data does not include members who hold educational registrations.</li>
<li>Practice site by LHIN information above refers to the first practice site listed in the HPDB. The HPDB collects employment data for up to three different practice sites and the first site listed is not necessarily the 'primary' practice location. Not all RHPs who hold an active registration listed a valid practice site in Ontario, or were working in their profession. As such numbers quoted above may not sum to 2011 totals.</li>
</ol>

<p>Disclaimer:</p>
						
<ol>
<li>The Information is being provided on an “as-is” basis. This data is derived from data that was originally obtained by the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (ministry) directly from health regulatory Colleges. The ministry therefore cannot and does not warrant or represent that the Information is accurate, complete, reliable or current.</li>
<li>You must reference the ministry as the source for the data in any publications, in the following manner: Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care, Health Professions Database, 2011 Submission Period © Queen's Printer for Ontario"</li>

<p>Suppression: Letter "S" is used to replace a value greater than 0 and less than 5. </p>

<p>The Census of Population collects data on every person in Canada based on where he/she lives on a set date or at a specific point in time. The 2011 Census was conducted in May 2011. The basic unit of measurement is the dwelling. In other words, the census begins by locating all places of residence in Canada. For each <a target="_blank" href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/help-aide/Metadata/OccupiedPrivateDwelling.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=01&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All">occupied private dwelling</a>, there is one household which consists of the sum of one or more persons residing in a dwelling.
The 2011 Census population counts for a particular area represent the number of Canadians whose usual place of residence is in that area, regardless of where they happened to be on Census Day. Also included are any Canadians staying in a dwelling in that area on Census Day and having no usual place of residence elsewhere in Canada, as well as those considered <a target="_blank" href="http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/prof/help-aide/metadata/NonPermanentResidents.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=PR&Code1=01&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All">non-permanent residents</a>.</p>

<p>The population counts presented in this profile are those collected from the Census in 2011. Please note that the most appropriate 2011 population figures for <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo02a-eng.htm" target="_blank">Canada, provinces, territories</a>, and <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/demo05a-eng.htm" target="_blank">census metropolitan areas</a> are the population estimates. See the explanatory note.</p>

<p>To ensure confidentiality, the values, including totals, are randomly rounded either up or down to a multiple of '5' or '10.' To understand these data, you must be aware that each individual value is rounded. As a result, when these data are summed or grouped, the total value may not match the individual values since totals and sub-totals are independently rounded. Similarly, percentages, which are calculated on rounded data, may not necessarily add up to 100%.</p>
